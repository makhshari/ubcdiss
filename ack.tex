\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Ali Mesbah, for his careful supervision, unhesitating support, and considerate guidance throughout the course of this research. Without his critical reviews and intellectual inputs, the completion of this thesis would not have been possible for me. I am also sincerely thankful to Dr. Karthik Pattabiraman and Dr. Sid Fels for accepting to be a part of my defence committee. 

I would also like to thank my friends and colleagues at Software Testing and Analysis Lab who always helped me with their constructive feedback. Last but certainly not least, I would like to thank my family for their love and constant support.
