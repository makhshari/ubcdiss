\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we proposed the first bug taxonomy for IoT systems. We also presented a series of categories of challenges in these systems with a qualitative study. Our findings can help both researchers and practitioners in understanding real-world pain-points of IoT development in the wild and designing new techniques and tools. Our findings shed light on the most frequent and severe IoT bugs, their correlations, and their root causes, and thereby allowing these faults to be avoided or detected early in the development of IoT systems.
